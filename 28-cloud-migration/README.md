- **Cloud Migration** is the process of moving your infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud.
- **MNC** (Multi-National Corporations) are large companies that operate in multiple countries. They are the most likely to migrate to the cloud. They are also the most likely to have monolithic, legacy systems.
- In the world of containers, **microservices** are the new hotness. They are small, independent services that can be scaled independently.
- **Rehosting** or **"Lift-and-Shift"** is the process of moving your infrastructure to the cloud without making any changes. If possible, this is the easiest and fastest way to migrate to the cloud.
- **Replatforming** involves making some changes to your infrastructure to make it more cloud-native first. This is a bit more expensive and time-consuming.
- **Refactoring** is the process of rewriting your code with the best possible approach. It is the most expensive and time-consuming approach.
- Terraform can be used to migrate your infrastructure to the cloud.
- CloudWatch can be used to monitor your infrastructure.
- **Retain** and **Retire** are two options for dealing with on-premises infrastructure that is no longer needed.
- **AWS MGN** (Migration Hub) is a service that can be used to replicate/migrate your application to AWS.
