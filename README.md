# learn-aws-devops

Following a YouTube series by Abhishek to evaluate AWS DevOps with theoretical and practical examles.

## Cool Things

- Auto-scale servers across multiple availability zones and without Kubernetes
- Good to know how companies that exclusively use AWS function

## Not Cool Things

- It's a Rube Goldberg machine of services
- Feels like a headless CMS with structured content and permissions for DevOps
- The best series is only 5 months old and already outdated
- Vendor lock-in
- Resources can be hidden if you're in a different region
