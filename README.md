# learn-aws-devops

Following a [YouTube series by Abhishek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8_r28jJ6AM&list=PLdpzxOOAlwvLNOxX0RfndiYSt1Le9azze) to evaluate AWS DevOps with theoretical and practical examles.

## Cool Things

- You can use Auto Scaling Groups to automatically scale servers across multiple availability zones, and without Kubernetes
- Good to know how companies that exclusively use AWS function
- Their managed Kubernetes (EKS) allows you to use serverless (Fargate) for burst workloads.

## Not Cool Things

- It's a Rube Goldberg machine of managed services
- Each service has its own UI, docs, and learning curve
- Feels like a headless CMS with structured content and permissions for DevOps
- The best series is only 5 months old and already outdated
- Vendor lock-in
- Resources can be hidden if you're in a different region
- $0.40 per secret/month to store secrets
- You can't use the free tier for everything
